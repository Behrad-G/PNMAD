**Pore Network Model for Advection and Diffusion.** 

This pore network modelling tool was developed by me and published in the following manuscript: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.04.007

The aim of the study was to forecast properties of porous material via pore network modelling. 

Following is an animaiton showing build up and flushing of a solute through the network of pores, where blue means no solute and orange means filled with solute.
